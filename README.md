# Nuclear Attack Survive Advice For India

This website gives advice for how people living in India and Pakistan can take steps to survive a nuclear war. The website can be read in English or Hindi while giving a chance to contribute to the translation. 

Most websites that deal with this topic focus on such an event taking place in the United States while ignoring the potential 1.5 billion lives at stake in South Asia. To the best of my knowledge this website is the first one to focus on improving the resilience of South Asians in the face of such a catastrophe.
