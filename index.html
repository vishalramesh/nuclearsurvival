                        <b>PROTECTION:</b> Find protection behind strong materials such as walls and bricks.
                        <ul class="unordered-list">
                            <li><b>Best:</b> Run as far underground as possible. Many cities have apartments with underground basements. Or find an underground subway.</li>
                            <li><b>Second Best:</b> The centre of a wide building, far away from windows. The middle-level floor of a thick building is preferred.</li>
                            <li><b>Third Best:</b> The part of a strong house that has best shielding.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <b>DISTANCE:</b> The farther from the blast the better.

                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <b>AFTERMATH:</b> The blast might create dangerous radioactive dust. Hide from any outside dust or winds. Do this even if you are far away from the blast impact: fallout can travel great distances on wind. Be cautious for a period of 2 weeks.

                                <b>EXPOSURE:</b> If you were exposed to fallout dust, for example if you were outside during or after the blast, follow these steps.
                                <ul class="unordered-list">
                                    <li>Shower with soap carefully across your whole body using clean water.</li>
                                    <li>Wash/shave off all your hair to remove any fallout. Do not use conditioner as this binds radioactive material to the hair.</li>
                                    <li>Blow your nose, clean your ears and eyes.</li>
                                    <li>If no shower available, wipe off as much material as you can manually until you can shower.</li>
                                    <li>Dispose of your dirty clothes far away. They are radioactive. Do not allow any dust to get back on you from your clothes or otherwise.</li>

                                <b>PLANNING:</b> Build an Emergency Supply Kit and Family Emergency Plan. During periods of heightened threats, increase supplies of food and water to be adequate for up to two weeks.
                                <ul class="unordered-list">

                                    <li>If <i>immediately</i> available bring your pet, wallet, phone, as much water as you can easily carry, and a portable radio, if you have one.</li>
                                    <li>Never look at the blast. If you look at the blast you will go blind.</li>
                                    <li>If immediately possible, set your bathtub (or a bucket) to fill with water.</li>

                <h3>About Website</h3>
                <br><br>
                <p>Much of the content on this website has been written for the 1.5 billion residents of India and Pakistan. According to a survey of 50 British national security experts, 4 in 10 considered South Asia to be the most volatile region with the greatest risk of a nuclear exchange, placing it ahead of the Korean Peninsula.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The website has been designed to load on most devices without significant delay. This assumption is based on the typical internet speed found in major cities in India (such as New Delhi). The website is hosted at a location such that it will not face disruption in the event of a nuclear war in South Asia.
